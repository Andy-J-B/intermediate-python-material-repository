# 2048_base.py
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Starter code for the “Expectimax 2048” assignment.
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# All functions that the test suite (or the CLI) will call are
# present, but every body is a stub that raises NotImplementedError.
# The student’s job is to replace each stub with a correct
# implementation while keeping the function signatures unchanged.
#
# ------------------- HOW TO USE -------------------
# 1. Open this file in your favourite editor / IDE.
# 2. Read the doc‑string of each function – it tells you exactly
#    what the function must do.
# 3. Implement the logic – you may copy ideas from the lecture,
#    from the solution file, or from any reference implementation,
#    but the final code must *only* use explicit loops / if‑statements
#    (no list‑comprehensions, no one‑liner dict look‑ups).
# 4. Run the supplied test script (`test_2048_cli.py`) after each
#    milestone to see red/green feedback.
# 5. When all tests pass, run this file directly (`python 2048_base.py`);
#    the UI will work and you can watch the AI play.

       "+------+------+------+------+").

             - If a cell value is 0, display an empty string.
